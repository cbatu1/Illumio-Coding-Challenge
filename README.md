# Illumio-Coding-Challenge
My solution to the Illumio Coding Challenge for the Summer 2020 Internships.

#### Thought Process Behind the Solution

Within the given timeframe I was able to implement a solution as described below. The `Firewall.java` is the main class that includes a constructor that takes in a file path as a parameter for the input rules.
It goes through the inputted csv file line by line and creates new `Rule` instances using the `Rule.java` class and adds them to 
a HashSet.

The `Rule.java` is used to create a rule by taking in the four parameters of a rule from the csv file line by line. 

The `Port.java` and the `IpAddress.java` classes are used to handle the cases of the ports and IP addresses either being inputted as a single 
unit or as a range. 

An `equals()` method was also added in the `Rule.java` class to check if any two rules are the same.

#### Testing

Testing of the `Firewall.java` class was done through `JUnit5` within the `FirewallTest.java` class where the `InputRules.csv` file was used as a parameter for the `Firewall` class.

#### Future Optimizations

To further improve linear runtime complexity, each rule could act as a key within a hashmap and any incoming packets could used to search the 
rules hashmap for any matching keys. 

#### Teams of Interest

I am currently interested in the Platform team, however, I am open to any position that is available :-) 
(I was told the Policy team does not have any openings left).
